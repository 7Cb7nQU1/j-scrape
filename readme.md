# j-scrape
**Java program to scrape images from reddit**

---

## To-Do (In order)
1. Decide whether to use a premade API wrapper or write our own (for both Reddit and Imgur)
1. Download images from Imgur
2. Determine if a link is to imgur or not, remove the nots
3. Grab a list of links using subreddit modes
4. Grab a list of links using user modes
5. Add more sorting methods
6. Add a watch mode (download as new ones are posted)
7. Port to Android/Web for more distribution possibilities

## Required Libraries

* TBD

## Notes

We will likely end up just skipping the API altogether and ripping images from imgur directly, but reddit will need a wrapper. Whether we write our own or import someone elses library is still a coin-toss.
